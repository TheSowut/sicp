procedures - processes (can be manipulated as LISP data)
primitive procedure - built in function
compound procedure - a user defined function
procedure definition - action of creating a user function
substitution model (for procedure application) - breaking down a complex function, replacing all function names with their bodies
	e.g. (+ (square 6) (square 10)) -> (+ (* 6 6) (* 10 10))
normal-order evaluation - alternative method for evaluation, which does not evaluate the operands, until their
	values are needed. Substitution model with addition steps and no number evaluation until needed. (lame)
applicative-order evaluation - interpreter evaluation model (nice), Lisp uses applicative-order evaluation.
case analysis - conditional statement
clause - body of a conditional statement - (cond <p1> <e1>)
predicate -	    				 <p1>
consequent expression			  	      <e1>
logical composition operators - and, or, not
