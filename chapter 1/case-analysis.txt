Case analysis is a conditional statement. The general form to express a conditional expression is:
(cond ((<p1>) <e1>)
      ((<p2>) <e2>)
      ((<p3>) <e3>))

(<p> <e>) are clauses. The first expression in each pair a predicate - an expression, whose value
is interpreted as either true or false. If a predicate's value is true, the interpreter returns the
value of the corresponding consequent expression <e>. If none of the <p>'s is found to be true, the
value of the cond is undefined.

(if <predicate> <consequent> <alternative>)
